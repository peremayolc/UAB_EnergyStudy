Here it will be explained what each document does inside the Predictions folder, from the datasets used to the resulting predictions.
Firstly, the only document besides this one outside of any folder exist regarding the data. Firstly we have the [DataSet](https://github.com/peremayolc/UAB_EnergyStudy/blob/main/Predictions/Copy%20of%20Consum%20energia%20Q%202018-2023%20horari.csv) used along the way. This contains hourly rates on energy expenditure in the Escola d'Enginyeria faculty building.

The first folder, named [SARIMA](https://github.com/peremayolc/UAB_EnergyStudy/tree/main/Predictions/SARIMA) contains everything on how we did the predictions on the SARIMA model, as well as the results. [Results 1](https://github.com/peremayolc/UAB_EnergyStudy/blob/main/Predictions/SARIMA/RESULTS%20SARIMA.png) is using one year prior as a test set. And [Results 2](https://github.com/peremayolc/UAB_EnergyStudy/blob/main/Predictions/SARIMA/RESULTS_SARIMA_TEST2YEARS.png) is using two year prior as a test set.
The notebook containing everything is named [Project Final Sarima](https://github.com/peremayolc/UAB_EnergyStudy/blob/main/Predictions/SARIMA/project_final_SARIMA.ipynb) where everything can be found on how we coded and constructed our SARIMA model. Further explanations on how the model works can be found on the main report.

The second folder, named [Random Forest Regressor](https://github.com/peremayolc/UAB_EnergyStudy/tree/main/Predictions/RandomForestRegressor) contains everything on how we created the model for rfr. Here you can also find results and procedures followed during the process. Some plots were included to show important information we got and used along the way.
1. A file containing the [train/test split](https://github.com/peremayolc/UAB_EnergyStudy/blob/main/Predictions/RandomForestRegressor/test_train%20split.png).
2. A file showing the [correlations between the features used](https://github.com/peremayolc/UAB_EnergyStudy/blob/main/Predictions/RandomForestRegressor/CORRELATIONS.png).
3. A file showing the [predictions vs the ground truth in the training set](https://github.com/peremayolc/UAB_EnergyStudy/blob/main/Predictions/RandomForestRegressor/ACTUAL%20vs%20PREDICTED%20TRAINING%20SET.png).
4. A file showing the [test predictions over the real data](https://github.com/peremayolc/UAB_EnergyStudy/blob/main/Predictions/RandomForestRegressor/PREDICTIONS.png).
5. A csv file containing the [real vs predicted values in the test set](https://github.com/peremayolc/UAB_EnergyStudy/blob/main/Predictions/RandomForestRegressor/data.csv).
