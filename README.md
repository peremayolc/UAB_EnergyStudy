# UAB_EnergyStudy

Helping the UAB's energy department make informed decisions on how to spend less money and maintain a certain level of comfort in the univeristy. We want to create an app with two different functionalities. These differ in terms of scale.

The first one is to make predictions on the expenditure for energy in different buildings. We want to check not only how the expenses are going to evolve, but also study the real impact of newer and greener energy sources. This will be done on datasets representing the Expenditure [KHW] based on time, temperature and other features. Information on the subject has been extracted from:
